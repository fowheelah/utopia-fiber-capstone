Download the Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS iso file from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

Use VMWare or Virtualbox or whatever you use to create the VM (use bridged network instead of NAT, up the RAM/processors to lower install time)

Create a new user other than root and give it administrator privileges

disable the root user (sudo passwd -l root)

configure the UFW firewall and then enable it (sudo ufw default deny incoming / sudo ufw default allow outgoing / sudo ufw allow 22 / sudo ufw allow 3306 / sudo ufw enable)

run the following in the terminal (sudo apt update, sudo apt install)

Follow this tutorial to install MySQL (USE % INSTEAD OF LOCALHOST WHEN YOU CREATE A USER, OTHERWISE IT WON'T HAVE REMOTE ACCESS!)
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04

If you run into problems creating a MySQL user with remote/admin privileges, I used the following commands
mysql> CREATE USER 'insertusernamehere'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'insertpasswordhere';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'insertusernamehere'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Install DBeaver on the device with a GUI that you will be using to connect to the MYSQL Database (https://dbeaver.io/download/)

On the DBeaver connection, you need to add a new driver property called allowPublicKeyRetrieval and give it the value true

You also need to edit the MYSQL config file and make the following change
(nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf)

At the bottom of the file add the following lines:
[mysqld]
port=3306 # or any other port
bind-address=0.0.0.0

Now restart MySQL (/etc/init.d/mysql restart)

Find the IP address of your linux server, the name of the database you want to connect to, the mysql username/password and use port 3306.
After entering all this information correctly you should be able to establish a connection to the database and begin creating tables/data.
