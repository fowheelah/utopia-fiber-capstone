Download the Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS iso file from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

Use VMWare or Virtualbox or whatever you use to create the VM (use bridged network instead of NAT, up the RAM/processors to lower install time)

Create a new user other than root and give it administrator privileges

disable the root user (sudo passwd -l root)

configure the UFW firewall and then enable it (sudo ufw default deny incoming / sudo ufw default allow outgoing / sudo ufw allow 22 / sudo ufw allow 5432 / sudo ufw enable)

run the following in the terminal (sudo apt update, sudo apt install)

Follow step 1 of this tutorial to install postgres:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04

Next, follow this tutorial to install TimescaleDB:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-timescaledb-on-ubuntu-20-04

Use the following command to create a new user for your TimescaleDB

su - postgres
createuser --interactive --pwprompt

Install DBeaver on the device with a GUI that you will be using to connect to the TimescaleDB Database (https://dbeaver.io/download/)

On the DBeaver connection, you will need to update your drivers for TimescaleDB.

You need to edit the postgres config file and make the following change:

nano /etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf

CHANGE THE LINE #listen_addresses = 'localhost' TO listen_addresses = '*'

You also need to edit the pg_hba.conf file as follows:

nano /etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf

CHANGE THE LINES
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

TO
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5

Now restart postgresSQL (sudo systemctl restart postgresql)

Find the IP address of your linux server, the name of the database you want to connect to, the mysql username/password and use port 5432.
After entering all this information correctly you should be able to establish a connection to the database and begin creating tables/data.
